`Unstable(reason: `[`String`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-string/index.html)` = "")`

Indicates that a part of the API is unstable.
This can range from bugs, to completely nothing being implemented / working yet.
It's advised not to use anything annotated with [Unstable](index.html),
but feel free to submit a PR!

It's important to note that at this stage, everything in Plumber is considered unstable, as
it is all subject to changes.
